Welcome!

Welcome to the Division of Computational Biology & Biomedical AI at the Chinese Center of Exercise Epidemiology (CCEE), Northeast Normal University.
We focus on developing next-generation AI systems for biomedical image analysis, cellular simulation, and computational modeling of exercise-related physiology and disease mechanisms.

Our research integrates modern deep learning—especially image generation, segmentation, and multi-modal biological simulation—to advance precision rehabilitation, digital pathology, and computational medicine.
